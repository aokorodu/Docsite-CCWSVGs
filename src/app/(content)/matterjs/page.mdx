# 2D Physics

## Matter.js

<MatterDemo />

Matter.JS is a popular javascript library used to simulate two-dimensional physics on web pages. While the library typically uses it's built-in renderer to draw graphics using the canvas element, we can also use it's physics engine to animate individual SVG elements.

## Matter.JS modules

We'll use Matter JS to create " rigid bodies" - two-dimensional objects posessing size, shape, elasticity (bounciness), friction etc. Then we'll use these matterjs bodies to animate our svg elements.

### Matter.Bodies

The **Bodies** module allows us to create simpe shapes, like circles or rectangle, or complex shapes like polygons using a collection of points (vertices). Each body we create will have properties like position, speed, rotation, and velocity that we'll use to position our svg elements.

### Matter.Body

The **Body** module has methods that we can use to update the individual Bodies we create with the Matter.Bodies module. We can use it to do things like change a body's position and orientation, apply forces, and set velocities.

### Matter.Composite

Once we define the bodies we'll use the Composite module to put them in a matter.js **world**, which can be thought of as a container for all of our rigid bodies.

### Matter.Engine

This is where the magic happens. The engine calculates physical properties for all bodies contained in a world - properties like position, speed, velocity, and rotation - based on the world each body is contained in, and interactions with other bodies in that world.

### Matter.Event

Event module allows us to listen for important events, like collisions. For example, if you're building a game where you are trying to shoot down some flying objects, you'll need to be able to detect when the collision between your projectile and your target.

### Matter.Runner

The Runner module is used to create an automatic update loop with the engine. Similar to window.requestAnimationFrame, it prompts the engine to re-calculate the position and orientation of each body in a world based upon a time delta. Since we can also just update the engine directly in the request animation frame, the Runner is optional.

### Matter.Render

"The Matter.Render module is a lightweight, optional utility which provides a simple canvas based renderer for visualising instances of Matter.Engine"

## Creating a simple matter.js particle animation

#### Installing the library

The most basic way to import the MatterJS library is via the script tag. (CDN information)

<Blocks>{`<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/matter-js/0.20.0/matter.min.js"></script>`}</Blocks>

(I've created a codepen that imports the library that you can use [here.](https://codepen.io/aokorodu/pen/xxvgarN))

### Set up the SVG

The first thing we'll need to do is set up our svg. I've created a group with an id of "holder" that will contain the particle graphic we'll eventually create.

<Blocks>{`<svg width="500" height="500" viewBox="0 0 1000 1000">
  <g id="holder"></g>
</svg>`}</Blocks>

### Create aliases for the modules

Now let's use javascript destructuring to create variables for all the MatterJS modules that we'll need for this lesson.

<Blocks>{`  const { Engine, Body, Bodies, Composite } = Matter;`}</Blocks>

### Create the engine and the runner

Next we'll create the physics engine and the runner. Again, the engine is responsible for all the physics calculations, and the runner is the game loop.

<Blocks highlight="2,3">{`  const { Engine, Body, Bodies, Composite } = Matter;
  const engine = Engine.create();
  const runner = Runner.create();`}</Blocks>

### Create the particle graphic and the MatterJS particle body.

We'll need variables for particle body and the particle graphic. The particle body will all the properties we'll need to animate the particle graphic.

We'll be appending the dynamically created particle graphic to the group with an id of "holder" in the svg, so we'll also need a variable for that.

<Blocks highlight="5,6,8,9">{`  const { Engine, Body, Bodies, Composite } = Matter;
  const engine = Engine.create();
  const runner = Runner.create();
  
  // particle vars
  let particleGraphic, particleBody;
  
  // holder variable
  const holder = document.querySelector("#holder");
`}</Blocks>

We'll need a method to create the particle graphic using the dynamic element creation skills we learned in an earlier lesson. The **initParticleGraphic** method below creates a circle with a radius of 50, and places it at the top-center of the SVG:

<Blocks highlight="11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18">{`  const { Engine, Body, Bodies, Composite } = Matter;
  const engine = Engine.create();
  const runner = Runner.create();
  
  // particle vars
  let particleGraphic, particleBody;
  
  // holder variable
  const holder = document.querySelector("#holder");
  
  const initParticleGraphic = () => {
    particleGraphic = document.createElementNS(namespace, "circle");
    particleGraphic.setAttribute("cx", "500");
    particleGraphic.setAttribute("cy", "50");
    particleGraphic.setAttribute("r", 50);
    particleGraphic.setAttribute("fill", "black");
    holder.appendChild(particleGraphic);
  };`}</Blocks>

Now let's create the body. The MatterJS **Bodies** module has a circle method that we'll use to create a 2D body that's the same size and shape as the particle graphic. It looks like this:

```js
,Bodies.circle(x, y, radius, [options]);
```

The options object is used to set all kinds of physical properties on a MatterJS body. We'll just be setting three - **id**, **friction** and **restitution**.

**id**: A unique name that the engine needs to keep track of the body within the world. The id _must_ be unique. If not, _all sorts of buggieness_ will ensue, as we'll see in a later lesson!

**friction**: A number between 0-1 that defines the friction of the body.

**restitution**: A number between 0-1 that defines the elasticity (bounciness) of the object

<Blocks

  highlight="15,16,17,18,1920,22,23"
>{`  const { Engine, Body, Bodies, Composite } = Matter;
  const engine = Engine.create();
  const runner = Runner.create();
  
  // particle vars
  let particleGraphic, particleBody;
  
  // holder variable
  const holder = document.querySelector("#holder");
  
  const initParticleGraphic = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const initParticleBody = () => {
    particleBody = Bodies.circle(0, 0, 50, {
      id: "particleBody",
      friction: 0,
      restitution: 0.99
    });
    
    ,Body.setPosition(particleBody, { x: 500, y: 50 });
  };`}</Blocks>

Once we create the particle body, we use the **setPosition** method of the Body module to position the body at the top of the SVG.

```
,Body.setPosition(body, { x: number, y: number });
```

Remember, the MatterJS body _isn't actually rendered at all_. Think of it as existing in a virtual world that we'll refer to every frame, and use it's position and orientation to position our graphic.

### Create the floor

To prevent our particle from just falling in infinite space, we'll need to create some sort of floor body. We want this floor to be different than our particle - it needs to be completely stationary and unaffected by gravity. We'll do this by creating a **static** body.

<Blocks
  caption="caption"
  highlight="11,12,22,23,24,25,26,27,28"
>{`  const { Engine, Body, Bodies, Composite } = Matter;
  const engine = Engine.create();
  const runner = Runner.create();
  
  // particle vars
  let particleGraphic, particleBody;
  
  // holder variable
  const holder = document.querySelector("#holder");
  
  // floor variable
  let floor;
  
  const initParticleGraphic = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const initParticleBody = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const initFloor = () => {
    floor = Bodies.rectangle(500, 1050, 1000, 100, {
      id: "floor",
      friction: .1,
      isStatic: true,
    });
};`}</Blocks>

We'll use the Bodies **rectangle** method to create the floor;

```js
,Bodies.rectangle(x, y, radius, height, [options]);
```

You might be confused by the values we have for the x and y position (x:500, y:1050). If we're creating a space that's 1000 units wide and 1000 units tall, and we want the floor to span the bottom of this space, shouldn't it's x=0 and y=1000? Well, the way MatterJS defines rectangles is a bit different than how they're defined in SVGs, in that the x and y position represent the _center of gravity_ of the body, and not the upper right hand corner. For rectangles, and circles, the center of gravity is always in the middle of the body. For irregularly shaped objects, the center can be elswhere, as we'll see in a later lesson.

Since the floor is 1000 units wide, to have it span the entire width of the space we'll need to place it horizontally at 500. Since it's 100 units tall, and we want the top of the floor to line up with the bottom of the space, we'll need to place it vertically at 1050.

#### Position the floor using it's center of gravity as it's x,y position.

![Drag Racing](/MatterJS_floor_body.png)

As you can see, instead of an eleasticity property the floor has a boolean **isStatic** property that is set to _true_. As a result, the floor isn't effected by gravity, and remains stationary.

### Creating the MatterJS world and everything in it

Now we have to create the world, and put the particle and floor in it using the **Composite** module:

```
,Composite.add(composite, [objects])
```

A Composite is just a container for a collection of objects. In this case we'll use the pre-defined **engine.world** as our composite, and add the particle and floor as an array of objects:

<Blocks
  caption="caption"
  highlight="26,27,28"
>{`  const { Engine, Body, Bodies, Composite } = Matter;
  const engine = Engine.create();
  const runner = Runner.create();
  
  // particle vars
  let particleGraphic, particleBody;
  
  // holder variable
  const holder = document.querySelector("#holder");
  
  // floor variable
  let floor;
  
  const initParticleGraphic = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const initParticleBody = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const initFloor = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const makeWorld = () => {
    Composite.add(engine.world, [particleBody, floor]);
  };
  `}</Blocks>

### Adding the game loop

Now it's time to animate our graphic using our trusted update/requestAnimationFrame method.

<Blocks
  caption="caption"
  highlight="30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38"
>{`  const { Engine, Body, Bodies, Composite } = Matter;
  const engine = Engine.create();
  const runner = Runner.create();
  
  // particle vars
  let particleGraphic, particleBody;
  
  // holder variable
  const holder = document.querySelector("#holder");
  
  // floor variable
  let floor;
  
  const initParticleGraphic = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const initParticleBody = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const initFloor = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const makeWorld = () => {
    Composite.add(engine.world, [particleBody, floor]);
  };
  
  const update = () => {
    // update the engine.
    Engine.update(engine);
    // look at the particleBody position and update graphic position accordingly.
    const pos = particleBody.position;
    particleGraphic.setAttribute("cx", pos.x);
    particleGraphic.setAttribute("cy", pos.y);
    window.requestAnimationFrame(update);
  };
  `}</Blocks>

The update loop is pretty simple. First we call the update method on our engine, which will advance it one "frame".

```
Engine.update(engine);
```

Then we get the position data from the particleBody, and set the cx and cy attributes of the particle accordingly. We then call requestAnimationFrame to continue the loop.

### Final step

Now all we need to do to kick things off is call all the methods we created above:

<Blocks highlight="34,35,36,37,38,39">{`  const { Engine, Body, Bodies, Composite } = Matter;
  const engine = Engine.create();
  const runner = Runner.create();
  
  // particle vars
  let particleGraphic, particleBody;
  
  // holder variable
  const holder = document.querySelector("#holder");
  
  // floor variable
  let floor;
  
  const initParticleGraphic = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const initParticleBody = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const initFloor = () => {
    // ...
  };
  
  const makeWorld = () => {
    Composite.add(engine.world, [particleBody, floor]);
  };
  
  const update = () => {
    //...
  };
  
  initParticleGraphic();
  initParticleBody();
  initFloor();
  makeWorld();
  initUI();
  update();
`}</Blocks>

And that's it! You can check out and play around with the code for this lesson [at this codepen](https://codepen.io/aokorodu/pen/GRVrbjz). There are a few minor differences to the code apove - I've added a **replay** button, for example - but for all intents and purposes it's identical to what we've just discussed.
