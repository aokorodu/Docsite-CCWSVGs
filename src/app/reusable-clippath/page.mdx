# ClipPaths

## the clipPath element

A clipPath defines a region of an element thats visible. Once a clipPath has been applied, anything "outside" the clip path isn't drawn by the browser.

Here's a pattern with no clip path applied:

<NoClip />

And here's the same pattern with a circular clip path applied:

<WithClip />

## The clipPath element

The clip path's shape is defined using the \<clipPath\> element, and the clip-path attribute, used by the element applying the clip path.

<Blocks>
  {`<defs>
    <clipPath id="circ_CP">
        <circle cx="250" cy="250" r="150" />
    </clipPath>
    ...
</defs>

<rect ... clip-path="url(#circ_CP)" />`}
</Blocks>

## clipPath attributes

**id**: Used to identify and apply the clip path

```
<clipPath id="clip-path-id">
```

**clip-path**: Used to apply the clip path

```
<rect ... clip-path="url(#clip-path-id)" />
```

The clipPath element can contain simple shapes, paths, or a combination thereof.

<StarClip />
