# Sprites

SVG sprite animation is a bit of a departure from the other animation techniques described in the course. It's much more like traditional, frame by frame animation used by animation studios to animate cartoons.

<WalkExample />

<br />

In this example I'll demonstrate how to create a simple animation of a bouncing ball. You can apply the principles I demonstrate to any time of sprite animation.

First, we'll create a 350x350 frame in Figma.

![sprites_figma_1.png](sprites_figma_1.png)

Next, use the shape tool to create a 50x50 ball.

![sprites_figma_2.png](sprites_figma_2.png)
![sprites_figma_3.png](sprites_figma_3.png)

Copy and paste the ball 6 times and align all the images side-by-side to the top of the frame.

![sprites_figma_4.png](sprites_figma_4.png)

Since the ball will be bouncing back up to the start position, we only need to create frames for the drop. We'll then reverse the animation to create the bounce effect.

![sprites_figma_5.png](sprites_figma_5.png)

We'll "squash" the last frame to give the ball a more elastic appearance as it hits the "floor".

![sprites_figma_6.png](sprites_figma_6.png)

Each ball will be used as a single frame in the bounce animation.

![sprite_frame_illustration.png](sprite_frame_illustration.png)

Our final Figma step is to export the frame as an svg.

![sprites_figma_7.png](sprites_figma_7.png)

Now let's set everything up. we'll create an inline SVG and use the **\<image\>** tag to import the bouncing ball svg.

<Blocks>{`<body>
    <svg width=200 height=500 
        viewBox="0 0 200 500">
            <image href="/bouncing_ball.svg"
                height="350" width="350" />
    </svg>
</body>`}</Blocks>

<BounceWorkingExample />

Let's create the animation.

<Blocks>{`<styles>
        .bounceHolder {
            animation-name: bounce;
            animation-duration: 1s;
            animation-iteration-count: infinite;
            animation-direction: alternate-reverse;
        }

        @keyframes bounce {
            from {
                transform: translate(0px);
            }
            to {
                transform: translateX(-350px);
            }
        }

</styles>`}</Blocks>

<BounceWorkingExample2 />

We shouldn't be able to see all of the frames of the animation, so lets create a clip-path so we can only see one ball at a time.

<Blocks highlight="2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11">{`<svg width=350 height=350 viewBox="0 0 350 350">
    <defs>
        <clipPath id="frame_cp">
            <rect x="0" y="0" width="50" height="350" />
        </clipPath>
    </defs>
    <g clipPath='url(#frame_cp)'>
        <g className={styles.bounceHolder} >
            <image href="/sprites_bouncing_ball.svg" height="350" width="350" />
        </g>
    </g>
</svg>`}</Blocks>

<BounceWorkingExample3 />

Now we have to update the animation so that the animation stops momentarily at each frame before "skipping" to the next one. For this, we use the **steps** animation timing function. There are seven frames, so we'll need 7 steps. And since each "frame" is 50 units wide, we'll be stopping at 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300. We'll use **"jump-none"** as our jump term, which essentially means that the animation will pause at the beginning, the end, and every step in between.

```
animation-timing-function: steps(<number>, <jumpterm>);
```

<Blocks highlight="6">{`<styles>
        .bounceHolder {
            animation-name: bounce;
            animation-duration: 1s;
            animation-iteration-count: infinite;
            animation-timing-function: steps(7, jump-none);
            animation-direction: alternate-reverse;
        }

        @keyframes bounce {
            from {
                transform: translate(0px);
            }
            to {
                transform: translateX(-350px);
            }
        }

</styles>`}</Blocks>

<BounceExample4 />

Finally we'll move the ball to the middle of the svg.

<Blocks highlight="7">{`<svg width=350 height=350 viewBox="0 0 350 350">
    <defs>
        <clipPath id="frame_cp">
            <rect x="0" y="0" width="50" height="350" />
        </clipPath>
    </defs>
    <g transform="translate(150 0)" 
        clipPath='url(#frame_cp)'>
        <g className={styles.bounceHolder} >
            <image href="/sprites_bouncing_ball.svg" height="350" width="350" />
        </g></g>
</svg>`}</Blocks>

<BounceExample />

We can create a visually more interesting sprite animation using the same techniques described above. For example, to create a walk sequence out of the spritesheet below, we'd just need to update the code to reflect the fact that each 'frame' is 200px wide, and that there are eight images so we'll need 8 "steps".

<Blocks>{`.walkHolder {
        animation-name: walk;
        animation-duration: 1s;
        animation-iteration-count: infinite;
        animation-timing-function: steps(8, jump-none);
    }

    @keyframes walk {
        from {
            transform: translateX(0px);
        }
        to {
            transform: translateX(-1400px);
        }
    }`}</Blocks>
