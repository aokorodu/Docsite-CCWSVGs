# transforms

## What is a transform?

A transform is simply a **geometric change** of an object. There are four types of transforms:

1. translate (movement horizontally or vertically)
2. rotate
3. scale
4. skew

Transforms can be applied via the transform presentation attribute or CSS.

## How do SVG and HTML transforms differ?

Transforms applied to svg elements are different from transforms applied to html elements. Each svg element - every shape, line, group, etc. - has its own coordinate system. When you apply a transform to an SVG element, you’re actually applying it to that element's coordinate system, and relative to the 0,0 point of that system.

This is different from transforms applied to HTML elements, where the transform is applied relative to the center of the HTML element’s bounding box. As a result, applying transforms to SVG elements can sometimes lead to unexpected results for those used to transforms of HTML.

## translate

A translate transform simply moves a shape (or group) the specified distance along the x and/or y axis. The value can be positive or negative.

<Blocks>
  {`<circle 
    cx="250" cy="250" r="250" 
    fill="yellow" 
    transform="translate(100 0)" />`}
</Blocks>

## rotate

A rotates transform rotates a shape (or group) the specified number of degrees.

If just one value - i.e. rotate(25), the rotation occurs around the (0,0) point of the element's coordinate system.

<Blocks>
  {`<rect 
    x="200" y="200" 
    width="200" height="200" 
    fill="grey" 
    transform="rotate(25)" />`}
</Blocks>

If three values - i.e. rotate(25 250 250), the first number represents the angle (25), and the second and third represent the point around which the rotation occurs. (250 250).
