# What is an SVG?

## What it's NOT

Most of the graphics you see on web pages today are what’s known as **bitmap** images - PNGs, JPEGs, and GIFs.

Bitmap Images are essentially a grid of pixels - lots and lots of tiny, colored, squarish dots - that, when combined, make up an image.

If you were to open up a png or jpg file with a text editor, you'd see something like this - rows and rows of unintelligible (to humans) text and numbers. All this data describes every single pixel in a bitmap image.

SVG is a text-based language for describing two-dimensional graphics.
It’s essentially a way to describe images using text that can then be rendered at any size by the browser.

```html
<svg
  width="500"
  height="500"
  viewBox="0 0 362 362"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
>
  <circle cx="181" cy="181" r="181" fill="#F3C729" />
</svg>
```
