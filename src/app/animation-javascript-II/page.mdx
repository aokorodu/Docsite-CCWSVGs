## Pure JavaScript animations

Next we'll create an animation without adding or removing css. Let’s try to replicate the animation from the CSS animation section, where we simply move the circle up and down.

<BackAndForthExample type={"linear"} />

We'll start off by getting a reference to the circle using querySelector.

<Blocks>{`<svg ...>
<circle id="my-circle" 
    cx="150" cy="150" 
    r="10" fill="green" />
</svg>

<script>
   const circ = document.querySelector("#my-circle");
   let xpos = 50;
   for (let i = 0; i < 400; i++) {
       circ.setAttribute("cx", xpos);
       xpos += 1;
   }
</script>

`}</Blocks>

You can probably guess that we'll be changing the position of the circle using the setAttribute method we demonstrated in the **Changing SVGs Dynamically** section.

Let's say we just want to move the circle from the top of the SVG to the bottom. You might think that we can simply use a loop to increase the circle’s cy attribute. It won’t work. Why?

<Blocks highlight="9,10,11,12,13">{`<svg ...>
<circle id="my-circle" 
    cx="150" cy="150" 
    r="10" fill="green" />
</svg>

<script>
   const circ = document.querySelector("#my-circle");
   let ypos = 0;
   for (let i = 0; i < 300; i++) {
       circ.setAttribute("cx", ypos);
       ypos += 1;
   }
</script>

`}</Blocks>

The circle’s cy attribute is indeed being updated, but the browser runs through all of the loop iterations so fast you won’t even see it. All you’ll see is the green dot at the final cy position. In terms of the browsers frame rate, all of the animation occurs on a single frame.

### requestAnimationFrame

In order to animate the circle, we’ll need to update it’s position once per frame. We do this using the browser’s requestAnimationFrame() method.

First, let’s create a method that increments the circle’s cy attribute:

<Blocks>{`
    const circ = document.querySelector("#my-circle");
    let ypos = 10;

    moveCircle();

    function moveCircle(){
        circ.setAttribute("cy", ypos);
        ypos += 1;
    }

`}</Blocks>

As a reminder, the browser has a own frame rate of about 60 fps. This means that it _repaints_ itself 60 times per second. The **requestAnimationFrame** method is used to call an animation function prior to “repainting” the screen. So you’ll want to pass it a function that updates some visual aspect of the svg - in this case, the moveCircle() method.

We'll recursively call the moveCircle method by adding the window.requestAnimationFrame to the end of the function. So the function runs, updates the cy value, and then calls itself to run again on the next frame.

<Blocks>{`
    const circ = document.querySelector("#my-circle");
    let ypos = 10;

    moveCircle();

    function moveCircle(){
        circ.setAttribute("cy", ypos);
        ypos += 1;

        window.requestAnimationFrame(moveCircle);
    }

`}</Blocks>
